The success of students (as judged by passing rate) varies widely across schools in the district.
The top 5 schools in terms of percent of passing students are all charter schools and are above an 84% passing rate.
The bottom 5 schools in terms of percent of passing students are all district schools and have below a 51% passing rate.

According to the scores by school spending table, there is a negative correlation of passing grades to the amount spent on each student. This is not expected, as one would hope that more funding would lead to higher scores.
